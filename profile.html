		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Unidentified Persons: In legal cases, "John Doe" (or "Jane Doe") is used to refer to a party whose true identity is unknown. This might be a person involved in a lawsuit whose name cannot be ascertained at the time of filing.
Anonymous Plaintiffs or Defendants: Sometimes, "John Doe" is used to protect the privacy of individuals, especially in sensitive cases involving minors or victims of crimes.The term "John Doe" dates back to England in the 14th century. It was used in legal documents to represent an anonymous party in action of ejectment (a legal action for recovering the possession of property). The names "John Doe" and "Richard Roe" were used to stand for the fictitious plaintiff and defendant, respectively.</p>
